<p>#300 - 128 West Hastings Street,<br>
Vancouver, BC, <br>
V6B 1G8</p>

<h5>ABOUT THE WannaWatch.it SERVICES. </h5>

<p>We provide users (“you”, “your”) with services, delivered via the WannaWatch.it website (currently located at http://WannaWatch.it.com), the WannaWatch.it mobile applications and/or any other platform or media through which we make such services available from time to time, that allow you to search for movies and find out where they're available, keep track of them in a queue, and join a community of individuals with similar tastes and interests (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

<h5>ABOUT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. </h5>

<p>These WannaWatch.it Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Services. You should also read WannaWatch.it’s Privacy Policy, currently located at <a href="http://WannaWatchit.com/privacy/">http://WannaWatchit.com/privacy/</a>, which contains important information about how we use your data. By accessing and using the Services, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service, whether you are a “Member” (meaning that you have registered and created an account with WannaWatch.it and have created a “WannaWatch.it Profile”), or you are a “Visitor” (meaning you are simply browsing the WannaWatch.it website or viewing content from or affiliated with WannaWatch.it). The term “User” refers to a Member or a Visitor, as applicable. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not access or use the Services.</p>

Each type of Content that you encounter has different rules and restrictions, as set forth below:</p>

<h5>WannaWatch.it CONTENT AND OWNERSHIP.</h5>

<h5>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. </h5>

<p>Content from other Users, advertisers and other third parties may be made available to you through the Services (“Third Party Content”).  We do not filter or otherwise exercise control over such Third Party Content.  Accordingly, you agree that we are not responsible for any such Third Party Content, including advertising and/or information about third-party products or services. We make no guarantees about the accuracy, currency, suitability, quality or legality of the information in such Third Party Content, and we assume no responsibility for unintended, objectionable, inaccurate, misleading or unlawful Third Party Content.  WannaWatch.it is not responsible for Third Party Content that contains or delivers viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted files, spyware, malware, or other harmful content or code.

By posting User Content, you hereby grant to us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, perform, display, create derivative works of, and distribute your User Content in any and all media or distribution method (now known or later developed) throughout the world.

You should only post User Content to the Services that you own and that you are comfortable sharing with others under the terms and conditions set forth herein. You may not post a photograph or video of another person without that person’s permission. Other Users of the Service will be able to view any Content you post to the Services, subject to your limited ability to restrict access to your Content by changing your account preferences and settings. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content posted by you on the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the licenses set forth in these Terms of Service, and (ii) your User Content and the use of it by WannaWatch.it as permitted by the license granted in these Terms of Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, Intellectual Property Rights, or other rights of any person.</p>

Any accounts posting, hosting or recommending Prohibited Content are subject to termination. We reserve the right to remove Content (including websites) that we determine in our sole discretion is unlawful, fraudulent, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable.

<h5>YOUR BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. </h5>

<p>Any breach by you of these Terms of Service may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and deletion of your WannaWatch.it Profile.</p>

<h5>LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. </h5>

<p>In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental or regulator requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect our systems and Users, to protect the property and rights of WannaWatch.it or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable, we may access and disclose any information and Content we consider necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, WannaWatch.it Profile information (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.), IP address, traffic information, usage history and posted Content.</p>

<h5>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. </h5>

<p>The Services are provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis, with no warranties whatsoever.

<h5>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. </h5>

<p>Under no circumstances shall WannaWatch.it be liable to any User on account of that User’s use or misuse of the Content or the Services.

This limitation of liability shall apply whether the damages arise from use or misuse of and reliance on the Content or Services, from inability to use the Content or Services, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of the Content or Services (including such damages incurred by third parties). Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.</p>

<p>You hereby release us, our officers, employees, investors, agents and successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, claims, and actions of any kind including, without limitation, personal injuries, death and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from (i) any interaction you have with other Users, or (ii) your participation in any of our offline events. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>

<h5>INDEMNITY. </h5>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold WannaWatch.it, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Content or Services or your violation of these Terms of Service.</p>

<h5>RESPONSIBILITY. </h5>

<p>Your interaction with other Users on the Services or with advertisers or other third parties, including any payment or delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the other User, advertiser or third party. You agree that WannaWatch.it will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such dealings or with respect to any third party’s use or disclosure of your personal information that you make available to them. If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including any User), we are under no obligation to become involved and you agree not to involve us unless we request otherwise in writing; however, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.</p>

<h5>THIRD PARTY SERVICES. </h5>

<p>The Services may contain links to third party websites, applications and/or services (“Third Party Services”) (i) placed by us as a service to those interested in this information; or (ii) posted by other Users. You use all such links to Third Party Services and Partner Communities at your own risk. To the extent such links are provided by us, they are provided only as a convenience and such links to Third Party Services do not imply our endorsement, adoption or sponsorship of or affiliation with such Third Party Service.

You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, for any Third Party Services and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate and choose appropriate settings for sharing your personal information before proceeding with any interaction with a Third Party Service.</p>
